- Groups concept
Lets take an example if there are 100 testcases and client asked us to execute only a few test cases from each class let assume only 4 testcases from 4 different classes. (include)

If you want to run all the smoke test cases exclude the group. How to do that (exclude)
How to do that using group.


- We have to provide them with a Tag which we have to run in groups (groups="Smoke") --tag

        @Test(groups={"Smoke"})
	public void mobilewebLogin() {
		 //Selenium code
		System.out.println("mobileWebLogin");
	}

- How to put in the same into the .xml file below the test -->
Both you can do include and exclude
--> <groups><run><include name="Smoke"></include></run></groups>
--> <groups><run><exclude name="Smoke"></exclude></run></groups>

<suite name="Loan Departement">
  <test name="Smoke Testcases">
	  <groups><run><include name="Smoke"></include></run></groups>
    <classes>
		<!-- These below are the class (package.class name)-->
      <class name="basic.test2"/>
      <class name="basic.test3"/>
    </classes>
  </test>
</suite>
